# smashlauncher-neo
Open source alternative to Smash Selector, AKA mod selector for Super Smash Bros. for 3DS

This isn't finished. Don't use it if you don't know C++.

## Features
Switch around modpacks like Smash Selector. Also supports loading .csv files that have toggleable options.

## Planned features and unimplemented thingies
- It doesn't download modpacks from URLs yet.
- It doesn't actually launch smash yet.
- There are bugs. Annoying ones.
- Whatever else Smash Selector has and this one doesn't, I guess.
